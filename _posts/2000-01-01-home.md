Dreams Made True, Inc. was founded in 2010 by David and Dayna Teske after being inspired by their daughter, Daleney Marie Teske.  
They took her initials, DMT, and created Dreams Made True, Inc., a non-profit organization dedicated to enhancing the lives of
girls with special needs, ages 5-25, and providing their families the opportunity to connect with and learn from each other.  
These young ladies will have the chance to unite and showcase their unique abilities through the beauty pageant format.
